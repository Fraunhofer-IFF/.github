# Fraunhofer IFF

Welcome to the GitHub Pages of Fraunhofer IFF ðŸ‘‹. We have two main categories of projects up and running on GitHub: Maintained open-source projects and archived paper artifacts.

## Maintained Open Source Projects

Our open-source projects are regularly maintained by a group of people at Fraunhofer. However, please keep in mind, that in the end this is not a commercial software product, only open-source.

## Archived Artifacts for Research Papers

This category contains unmaintained pieces of software that we publish in addition to our research. Mostly high-profile venues recommend doing that and we are gladly following these guidelines. Please be aware, that these projects are mostly point-in-time artefacts, with their main use being to provide transparency into our research process.

## Looking for a Job?

We are always looking for poeple interested in open-source development. Please have a look at our [recruiting page](https://www.iff.fraunhofer.de/de/jobs-karriere.html).
